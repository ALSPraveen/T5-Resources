Minikube :(local)

Minikube is a tool that enables you to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally on your machine. 
It is primarily used for development and testing purposes. Minikube creates a virtual machine on your local system and sets up a Kubernetes cluster within that virtual machine. 
This allows developers to experiment with Kubernetes features and deploy applications in a local environment without needing access to a full-scale Kubernetes cluster.


Kubectl:(local or remote)

kubectl is the command-line interface (CLI) tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. 
It allows you to perform various operations on Kubernetes clusters, such as deploying and managing applications, inspecting cluster resources, scaling deployments, and debugging issues. 
With kubectl, you can issue commands to Kubernetes API server to perform actions such as creating, updating, or deleting resources within a Kubernetes cluster.



To summarize ,Minikube is used to set up a local Kubernetes cluster on your machine, while kubectl is the command-line interface (CLI) tool used to interact with that cluster.
